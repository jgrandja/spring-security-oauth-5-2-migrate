= Spring Security OAuth 5.2 Migration Sample

This sample should be used for migrating a Spring Security OAuth 2.x application to Spring Security 5.2.

This is the Spring Security 5.2 sample and the corresponding Spring Security OAuth 2.4 sample is https://github.com/jgrandja/spring-security-oauth-2-4-migrate[here].

See the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/wiki/OAuth-2.0-Migration-Guide[OAuth 2.0 Migration Guide] for further details.

== Run the Sample

* Build the sample -> `./mvnw clean package`
* Run Keycloak -> `cd keycloak && ./run.sh`
** IMPORTANT: Make sure to modify your `/etc/hosts` file to avoid problems with session cookie overwrites between `client-app` and `keycloak`. Simply add the entry `127.0.0.1	auth-server`
* Run Resource Server -> `./mvnw -f resource-server spring-boot:run`
* Run Client App -> `./mvnw -f client-app spring-boot:run`
* Go to `http://localhost:8080` and login using *user1/password*
